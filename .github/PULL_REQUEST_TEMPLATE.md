Dear Maintainers,

Please accept this PR that addresses the following issues:
+ *(replace with a link to GitHub issue)*

Testing Done:
+ Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please specify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our coverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.

Reminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):

+ Your PR's title must reference an issue on GitHub Issues. For example, a PR called "[#issue-number] My Amazing PR" would close issue #issue-number. Please open a new issue if required!
+ Please squash your commits when possible (look [here](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) and [here](https://dgdgit.chop.edu/gist/GonzalezMA/41ceb5f58ffec0e7db3c87dbee72038b) for examples) and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). Summarized as follows:

    + Separate subject from body with a blank line
    + Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    + Do not end the subject line with a period
    + Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)
